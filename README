Short readme for people to read BEFORE they touch Smart-Ass.
We have developed Smart-Ass 2, been updated for the new
DB structure, and on.

support people installing this to be absolutly stable :p.

Remember! Development releases may not be ready fully or
can do some wierd things. You have been warned.
