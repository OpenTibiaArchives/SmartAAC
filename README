Short readme for people to read BEFORE they touch Smart-Ass.
We have developed Smart-Ass 2, been updated for the new
DB structure for otserv, and on.

We recommend you use this software on an Apache Server, and operates with an otserver from the SVN repositories.
If you don't know where those respositories are to compile an otserver
goto http://youdie.de and goto the SVN part of the OpenTibia project.


--------

What you basicly need:

* A web server (preferably Apache)
* PHP 5
* MySQL
* GD, SimpleXML to be working
* Write permissions for the webserver to write to the Smart-Ass directory! (Or well the following directories)
	* /conf.php
	* /Install/
	* /Includes/counter/
	* /Admin/logs/
	* /Admin/news/data/users.txt

--------

To get started off:

* Just goto index.php and you should be redirected to the Installation
* You'll be asked things, etc etc, and asked to fill out fields

--------

Admin/News/Logs section access:

Your username and password you set during the installation will give you access to
the admin panel, news panel and the logs directory.	

The logs are located in a directory in the 'Admin' directory.

There are images that are images of CIPSofts monsters from Tibia. We take no responsibility for the use of the images of the creatures/monsters,
they were just put in to the software to boost our own knowledge of programming PHP (as why this project was created originally;
Smart-Ass).
